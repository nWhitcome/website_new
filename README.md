# My Personal Website
It seems that you've stumbled across the Github page for my website. I've worked on it on and off for a while using the skills Ive learned at work.

## What I used
This website was made with Node.js on the backend and Vue.js on the front end. I used a couple of other frameworks like Express through NPM and hosted the site with Heroku after buying a domain from Google.

## Issues
Every time I go to work on this project I forget that I'm on the master branch. That's a rookie mistake and one that I'm trying to be more aware of, which is difficult when you're the only person working on a project.

This page also has some issues on Apple devices and browsers that I'm not sure how to fix since I don't own any Apple products to test on. I'm sure my brother can help me out with that. Making a universal website is hard, man.

## Things I'm proud of
*Getting the transparent text at the top to work took some time. I had to layer the text twice, once to cut out of the white banner and once to layer black text on top of that. Figuring out how to do that effectively took a long time.

*The universal colored buttons seem simple, but I'm oddly proud of how they turned out. I was tired of doing all of the CSS required to have a bunch of different buttons of different colors next to the project names so I made a component that took a color for the background and darkened it when it was hovered over. It's pretty simple but it made my life a lot easier.
